# Task Tracker Project

## What is it about?
Task Tracker is a website that is done with React.JS
The website allows users to add a task into their to-do list where they are asked for the title of the task, the day and time and they have an option to set a reminder which is represented by a green left border.
When the user adds a task, they have the option to view its details which will show the details independtely from other tasks.
They can also delete the task permanently.
When the user adds a task, its information will be stored in a JSON file called `db.json` so that when the website refreshes or closes, the tasks can still be there. Same with the delete button where it deletes the task from the JSON file.

## How to Run The Website.
1. first clone the repo into your local machine
2. Make sure npm is installed on your machine
3. do `npm install` in your folder where the project is located
4. to start the JSON server, write `npm run server`
5. to start the website, write `npm start` or `npm run start`
